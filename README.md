> Hydra replies on an instance of Redis, if you need to learn more about Redis, see our [Redis quick start guide](https://youtu.be/eX7EamF_WuA).

If you're just getting started with Node Microservices and you have ExpressJS experience you should first look at our [HydraExpress](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra-express) project.
